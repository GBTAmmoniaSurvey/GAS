This repository includes the scripts used to prepare the GBT Ammonia Survey (GAS, PIs: Jaime E Pineda and Rachel Friesen). 

It also facilitates the data reduction and analysis of all the data produced by the survey. 
We have developed a pipeline that automatically reduced the survey data, with calibration done 
using the gbt-pipeline, imaging carried out with a custom made gridding package, and line-fitting 
carried out using pyspeckit.

More information is available in the documentation, avaliable [online at readthedocs.io](http://gas.readthedocs.io).
